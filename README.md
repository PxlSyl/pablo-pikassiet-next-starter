## Introduction

This artist starter template is a very hard fork from Nextplate and Tailwind Next Starter Blog, mixed together with my own ideas.

## Note

I don't have that much time so I need help to write and replace some posts for the doc, for testing and debugging, and even for news ideas if you have some. Feel free to open issues or make pr!
